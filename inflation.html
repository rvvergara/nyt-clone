        </header>
        <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded
            so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                <b>THE UNIVERSE</b> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky
                Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across.
                But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                <b>NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from
                one
                side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and
                cold
                to
                mix into an even temperature.

                <b>DISTANT COFFEE</b> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction.
                You
                see a
                coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.

                <b>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</b> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
                coffee
                cup,
                at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction,
                you
                might
                want to look for another explanation.

                carry
                coffee
                cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a
                single
                coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.

            <section class="factors" id="factors-6"><b>INFLATION</b> solves this problem. The theory proposes that,
                less
                than a
                trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
                ripples
                in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                universe.</section>
            <section class="factors" id="factors-7"><b>FLUCTUATION</b> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these
                ancient
                fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over
                from
                the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</section>
            <section class="factors" id="factors-8"><b>EXPANSION</b> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central
                pot
                expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
                inflation.
                And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
