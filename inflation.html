            <b>THE UNIVERSE</b> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky
            Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across.
            But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

        <section class="factors" id="factors-2">
            <b>NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
            side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold
            to
            mix into an even temperature.

        <section class="factors" id="factors-3">
            <b>DISTANT COFFEE</b> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You
            see a
            coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
        </section>
        <section class="factors" id="factors-4">
            <b>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</b> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee
            cup,
            at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you
            might
            want to look for another explanation.

        <section class="factors" id="factors-5"><b>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> There has not been enough time to carry
            coffee
            cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single
            coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.

        </section>
        <section class="factors" id="factors-6"><b>INFLATION</b> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less
            than a
            trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
            ripples
            in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</section>
        <section class="factors" id="factors-7"><b>FLUCTUATION</b> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these
            ancient
            fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over
            from
            the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</section>
        <section class="factors" id="factors-8"><b>EXPANSION</b> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
            expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
            inflation.
            And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
