        <span>The Theory of Inflation</span>
    </header>
    <p class="Inflation-caption">Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how
        the universe expanded
        so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.
    </p>
    <div class="container">

        <p id="first" class="absolute-row-1">
            <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way
            galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
            Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.
        </p>
        <p id="second" class="absolute-row-1">
            <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast
            distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered
            patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
        </p>
        <p id="third" class="absolute-row-1"><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a
            telescope to look a mile in
            one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and
            how
            much it has cooled.</p>
        <p id="fourth" class="absolute-row-1">
            <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a
            similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
            in
            every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
        </p>
        <p id="fifth" class="absolute-row-two"><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to
            carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow
            filled
            from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
        <p id="sixth" class="absolute-row-two"><strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes
            that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of
            light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures
            of the universe.</p>
        <p id="seventh" class="absolute-row-two"><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected evidence of
            these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is
            energy
            left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
        <p id="eigth" class="absolute-row-two">
            <strong class="g-sc">EXPANSION</strong>&nbsp; Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
            expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
            inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
